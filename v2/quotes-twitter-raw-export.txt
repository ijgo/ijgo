Gameâ€“Changer thread.  Listen up!  Every business needs at least one Key Performance Indicator (KPI).  KPIs allow you to track your efforts against something measurable.  Most new businesses use 'revenue' as their KPI.  This is not good enough. Here's why.

How I stay motivated: a thread  -Set goals you're passionate about. It's not hard to do shit you enjoy. Some days suck but it's also about the Marathon and the Vision.  -Surround yourself with big players. My friends are working with hundreds of thousands and talking millions.
-Physically write down your goals. Mine hang by my closet door. I see them every day. This shit ain't cheesy  -Speak your goals out loud. Don't tell everyone your goals.. Just get use to the sound of your ideas. YOU are the only person you gotta convince
The point of setting goals is to the remind yourself why you wake up each morning.  To remind yourself why you're on this earth.  To remind yourself what you stand for.  We're surrounded by chaos and unlimited stimulus.. Social media, ads, people, etc

We are all powerful beings with immense amounts of energy, but only if we are able to cultivate and harness the energy.  If we easily waste it away and not treat it with respect.  This energy is lost and your power is stripped away.  This is what THEY want you to become.
Every minute you spend watching porn.  The more sex becomes a powerful driver to your being.  It becomes the center of your existence.  This is the opposite of enlightenment.  Sex being the center of your life without the ability to get it is how we get depressed incels.
Break that central control of sex.  Eventually you will begin to remove the power that sex possessed over you in the past.  You will begin to become free.  Abundance flows, and inner love happens.  Freeing yourself from the chains you inadvertently got into.
There are massive blockages, programming, and casualties that come from masturbating from pornography.  The more you do it the longer it takes to get rid of the programming.  At some point you completely lose the ability to regain your essence.  It's lost. Maybe in next lifetime.

The future suffers when potential is wasted on being submissive to mindless desires. These are forces that are base characteristics and do not have profound or articulated referential connection. They cannot because they are primal.
When the opportunity to be more primal is converted, by way of intelligent transformation, from one situation into something that yields great self control and wilfull resistance to the point of non effort, from mindless desire and meaningless repetition.

This is an example of how it is not enough for a woman to just break up with a Beta male. She must destroy him in order to purge her subconscious of the fact that her Hypergamous intuition failed her. He got past the filter and she had sex with a lesser male.

'I work out 5 times a week I eat well  I read daily for an hour I sleep 8 hrs a night I journal daily  I don't use social media  I don't drink alcohol I have a loving family &amp; friends'   BUT YOU HAVE NO MISSION.  This is Exactly why you still feel empty.
When you wake up you probably check your phone first.  See who messaged you on Facebook, how many likes you got on Instagram. Read what happened on Twitter &amp; see who e-mailed you  Run another round checking it all, scroll for an hour, delay the real work.  THIS IS BAD HABITS
You command her when having sex. With your body, and with your words.   You can use commands and suggestions to amplify, and build sensations. Then anchor those feelings, and link them back to you.   Some examples below. The imagination is your limit.  (Thread)
1. Drive sensations  'You feel amazing'  'Realise how you feel that incredible sensation growing. How your body feels so alive, so full of energy etc'  'Notice how you feel that special point that gives you so much pleasure feeling more and more intense etc'
RESOLUTIONS are for Birthdays  WISHES ARE FOR NEW YEARSðŸ¥³  Resolutions are personal/selfish &amp; visions for self-improvement  Wishes are non-personal/selfless &amp; a vision for wider (family, community, country, world) improvement   They have been making you do it backwards all along!
Women fall in love with you when they are doing things for you, not the other way around.  Let that sink in.
Key:  Speak slowly, deeply.   Use second person.  Calibrate and adjust. How does she respond? What works well?   Use ambiguity. 'You feel amazing' - you or her feeling that?   Let her fill the blanks. 'That special point', 'That sensation'- she will give it meaning and amplify.

Theres really 2 paths in each visualization event.  2 ways it can go -- increase the 'amplitude' of the visualization (stronger passion behind INTENT!)  Or...  Increase the leverage behind the visualization (better angle entry point via the other into the 'event')  Let's talk.
An outcome on the premise of a days energy.  Now this is where numerology really shines.  Want to setup for x outcome? Maybe use a 22 day.  For money? Maybe use a 28 day.  For shifting a way someone thinks?  Maybe at the beginning of a moon cycle on a 5 day...  Ooops.
Visualization operates much like an electric circuit  You are quite honestly 'energizing' a circuit of energy, and with enough current, the outcome ticks out  The question is, can you connect the dots to be able to understand where to put the resistances, circuit boards and such?
Mistake #1: not tracking progress visually.  When we mow a lawn, there's clear visual feedback - grass neatly trimmed.  When we exercise 1x, 2x, 7x... we probably won't see a change.  That's demotivating.  Without a clear measure of progress, you'll get demotivated.
Tip #1: Mark your progress visually (and look at it every day.)  Use a progress bar you fill in with a pencil. Use a spreadsheet. Use a calendar where you put âœ”ï¸ if you do X. Use âœ… on paper or in your favorite work tool.  Whatever you do - make it visual, look at it every day.
Over time your recovery time will extend, instead of one day and youre good itll move to 2. Maybe even a tad longer in the future.   Have to get in shape early or else youre paying a game that is quite literally 2x more difficult.

Why dont you take action on your ideas?  Because you believe in those ideas failing more than you do succeeding.  The second youre able to flip this, you wont even have to try and take action - you just naturally will.

My point being.... just because these dudes did everything 'right' they aren't better than you.   You might have 'fucked up' in younger years   BUT  You still have a clear path to 'making it'... a MUCH BETTER path.  Get More out of this life.
If someone tells you no just remember that you are an adult and you can do whatever you want.
Building a system and a business happens step by step.  First, you put the schedule in place.  Then you act on the schedule.  Then you make others act on the schedule for you.  You make them earn money for you.  Get an overview of the system.  Execute each step of the system.
You are not going to build a successful business by accident.  It takes work. It takes strategy. It takes discipline. It takes everything.  If you want to be successful, don't rely on luck, rely on yourself.
Having a growth mindset is taking a rebellious attitude towards life. You're a rebel becuase the majority of people around you don't have a growth mindset.
Self reliance is paramount.  The more you need other people, the less power you have. Cant cut em off.  Corollary: The more you are needed by someone, the more power YOU have.  The rarer your skillset, the harder it is to replace you = ensures indispensability.
In another timeline theres a version of you who...  -is making the money you want -fucking the girl you want -their life is awesome   And you wont have it because you want things to be easierâ€
BREAKING:  If you rely on Motivation to get things done, you don't have self-discipline.  Self discipline is the skill of doing things when you DON'T want to do them.
Here's a message from @CesarKuriyama that we can get 1000 % behind:  'It's about dividing, dividing, and dividing something you want to do until the task at hand is sooo easy that couldn't possibly not do it.'  Watch this 8 min talk: https://t.co/PMsFR1885D
When you approach a girl your frame is:   'She looks promising. Let's see if she is the type of girl I may get to like'.   You have plenty of choice.
Having sex with girl in rotation a while back. As she comes I tell her to feel totally, completely, incredibly, mineâ€. She says 'I am yours' - louder, and louder.   After sex she turns and asks:  Her: 'Are you mine?'  Me: I look at her, smile, pause. 'That's the wrong question'

I like esoteric works. But something I realized a while back.  If it doesnt help you improve your life...drop it like a rabid animal.  Theres a reason 99% of those ppl are weak, broke, and cant get girls.   Live life, learn life, master life.

A lot of women are only feminists until a guy with abs and bicep veins asks if she likes to be choked.
Let me tell you this.  Buying products in bulk isn't always the best scenario.  If you order 500 products and they don't sell, you lose money.  So what do we do?  When you start selling the product, The first 20 orders should be sent from Amazon.  Everything is on Amazon anyway.

If you make the experience real enough, you can trick the brain into experiencing anything   Lets say youre a bit tired. You need a pick me up.  Grab a glass of water.  TELL YOUR BRAIN:  This is ADRENALINE JUICE. When I drink it I will be filled with an INTENSE SURGE in energy.
Was talking to gym bro I shoe pilled 2 months ago  He must be in this corner because he started neck pilling me (instant joy, like finding longlostbro)  Told me to try neck chops, literally chop yourself in the neck  Had to give back so I told him to get sun on his balls  BONDING
Penis goes into Vagina.  Men, masculine, Yin, is giving energy. Women, feminine, Yang, is receiving energy. Extrapolate this to explain everything.  The reason a woman is the way she is, is because of the men around here OR LACK THEREOF.  Its just how the Universe works. https://t.co/mwO2kZsFa9

If you are using visualization for future success and goal completion  You need to *feel* the positive physical emotion of what it would be like to achieve that goal  Not just picture it.  If you dont feel it, you arent visualizing   Took me a while to really understand this
All great change happen from looking at the man in mirror and saying:  What a fucking loser.â€  Running from hell is a far greater motivator than running towards paradise.
All great projects start from a state of flow  Women have the propensity to disrupt your execution, to murder your creativity &amp; to distract you from your objective   Dont keep complaining women around when you work   SHUT UP FEMALE.  Be happy. Bring me coffee. I fuck you later.

There are 3 primary drivers of results in life:  1) Your luck (randomness). 2) Your strategy (choices). 3) Your actions (habits).  Only 2 of the 3 are under your control.  But if you master those 2, you can improve the odds that luck will work for you rather than against you.
Man becomes so preoccupied with his problems, that he can no longer live without them.  If he is not finding a solution to his problem, he feels something is amiss.  When problems become a man's friend  And searching for solutions becomes his friend  He lives as his own enemy.
